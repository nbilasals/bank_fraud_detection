# bank_fraud_detection

Bank fraud detection is the process of identifying and preventing fraudulent activity in the banking system. This can be a complex task, as fraudulent activity can take many forms, such as unauthorized transactions, identity theft, and money laundering.

To detect bank fraud, financial institutions and other organizations use a variety of tools and techniques, including machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to analyze patterns in data and identify unusual or suspicious activity that may indicate fraudulent behavior.

There are many different approaches to using machine learning for bank fraud detection, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning. In supervised learning, a model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct output (e.g., fraudulent or non-fraudulent) is provided for each input. In unsupervised learning, the model is not given any labeled examples and must discover patterns in the data on its own. Semi-supervised learning is a combination of the two, where the model is given some labeled examples and some unlabeled examples.

By using machine learning algorithms for bank fraud detection, financial institutions and other organizations can more effectively identify and prevent fraudulent activity, which can help to protect customers and maintain the integrity of the banking syste
